Here I am uploading the files in which I have used the session feature in our project, all that's left is , we need to set the css for the session credentials and the associated logout/login buttons on the pages.

I have uploaded all the files, there are changes made in almost all the files according to the requirement of session feature, we need to now set the login/logout button and the user credentials which are shown on each page.

The Credentials and the button on each page is shown by the following line of code:
{% if 'logged_in' in session %}
                        <p>Logged in as: {{ session['username'] }}</p>
                        <a href="{{ url_for('logout') }}">Logout</a>
                    {% else %}
                        <p>You are not logged in. <a href="{{ url_for('authenticate') }}">Login here</a></p>
                    {% endif %}
